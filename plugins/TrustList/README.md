## About
This plugin generates a list of plugins that are desirable to remove. Useful if you have a huge list.

The plugin will not touch the official plugins, which are on the official BetterDiscord website, and will recommend removing unofficial plugins. It will not remove anything manually, it will just point out that your MessageLogger or AnimatedStatus violates the terms of use.
